    "Through this project I aim to select the safest borough in Toronto based on the number of crimes, and explore the different venues located in each neighborhood that will be clustered overall using k-mean clustering.\n",
    "This report will primarily target immigrants that arrive in Toronto every year in an attempt to relocate themselves and start a new life. Safety and amenities have been selected as primary goals when selecting a neighborhood and during the research I will focus on the safest borough within Toronto through examining crime statistics and explore the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood so that the best neighborhood suited to the clientâ€™s need can be selected. As a student living in Toronto, Canada, I was able to observe thousands of immigrants settle down in various places across Toronto every year. Hopefully, this project will aid individuals or families when deciding on a neighborhood to select when looking for an apartment.\n"
